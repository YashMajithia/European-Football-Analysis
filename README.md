# European-Football-Analysis

Background:

The European Football Data Analysis is the analysis of dataset of Top 5 European Football clubs,

About the dataset:

The dataset consists of statistics ranging from 2008 to 2016 seasons, with the leagues in focus being on football leagues from Belgium, Italy, France, Germany and England.

The dataset also contains information about all the matches, betting information, players, matches, squad formation, etc.

Process:

The first step involves importing the data into the Python notebook, and importing all the necessary libraries that will be useful for analysis. The libraries used for this project are : pandas, numpy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, tablib

The next step involves deriving a brief statistics, and removing further anomalies, if any.

After these two steps, the analysis of the data is kickstarted.

Analysis:

The overall analysis has been done keeping in mind that the analysis will be assisting the audience wanting to start following the sport and they get to have a basic idea along with some advance analytics to intrigue them into wanting to research and follow the sport more.

The First Part of the analysis includes a general heads up over matches. This includes goals scored by players, seasonal trends and patterns noticed in the Leagues, It also gives us an idea that teams love to play at their home ground, as most teams have scored more at home than on away grounds.

The Second Part of the analysis gives us a basic insight into players, showing which foot they prefer, the tallest, the oldest and the heaviest players.

The Third Part helps the audience to know the attributes of the players, how the players attacking and defensive workrate affects the overall rating of the players and also shows the overall rating matrix.

The Final Part of the analysis focuses on team attributes, which gives the audience an idea as to how teams prefer their playing style, whether it is attacking, defensive, counter-attacking or heavy defending.

Challenges:

The major challenge which was faced during the analysis of the dataset was ther was no proper connectivity between the different leagues, players, attributes, etc. This was a major hamper into showcasing creativity, as it was very difficult to analyse the data and give insights on league level and team level analysis.
